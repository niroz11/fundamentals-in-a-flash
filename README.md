# Fundamentals In A Flash

### Abstract:
The goal of this project was to create a study tool for students that focuses on a technical topic. I decided to create a quiz application where users can test their knowledge on JavaScript fundamentals. As a user answers questions correctly they can choose to continue test their knowledge on those questions or only on the questions they have yet to master.
